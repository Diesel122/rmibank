====== Author: Manuel Mendez

====== The rmi.bank project illustrates Java's RMI to implement 
	   a bank using interfaces, object factories, and a distributed
	   deployment.


====== Note:
	   When the code resides, as it is in git, in folder myj, with
	   myj/src/rmi/bank and with empty folders myj/classes the 
	   following commands can be executed from the command line, without
	   having to modify (or use) a pre-defined classpath.
